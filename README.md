These are my learnings from an udemy course

Data Structures & Algo in swift 

Time Complexity:
1. Constant Time 
2. Linear Time 
3. Quadratic Time
4. Logarithmic Time  - Binary Search
5. Quasilinear Time

Node:
- Root
- Child -> left child & right child 
- Leaf 

Linked List 
- Elements are connected to each other by reference called Nodes
- 1st node in the linked list is called Head
- Last node is called Tail node

	Operations:
	- push
	- append
	- insert
	- pop
	- removeLast
	- remove

Stack (LIFO)
- Push
- Pop

Queue (FIFO)
- Peek
- Enqueue
- Dequeue

Recursion 
- Base case - which stops the recursion.
- Recursive case 

Trees: 
- Depth First Traversal 
- Level Order Traversal
- Search 
- Binary Tree (can have max of: 2 Children only - left & right)
    - In order Traversal -> leftChild -> Node -> RightChild
    - Post order Traversal -> leftChild -> RightChild -> Node
    - Pre order Traversal -> Node -> leftChild -> rightChild
- Binary Search Tree 

Linear Search 
- O(n)

Binary Search 
- Sorted array
- Middle index - left or right 
- Best Time: O(1)
- Worst Time: O(log n)

Bubble Sort
- Unsorted
- Best Time: O(n)  (if already sorted)
- Worst Time: O(n^2)

Selection Sort
- Swap the minimum element in the array with current index 
- Move to next index and repeat step 1
- Best Time: O(n^2)
- Worst Time: O(n^2)

Insertion Sort
- Unsorted
- Best Time: O(n)
- Worst Time: O(n^2)

Graph:
Consist of
- Vertices / Vertex
- Edges / Edge

Types of Graphs:
- Weighted graphs
- Directed graphs 
- Undirected graphs (bi-directional) 

Adjacency List 
- Most commonly/widely used way to create and represent a graph
